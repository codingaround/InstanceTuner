# InstanceTuner
Set limited type instances and overload functions like Java in python

Do you want to never write 'raise' or 'assert' in your python code when it comes to function arguments?

@setFunction
def test(a: int):
    pass
  
This package will raise error for you if 'a' does'nt give integer value 

with checking types by using 'setFunction' we are able to distinguish signatures of functions from each other like java compiler and using it for overload purposes
